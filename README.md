Fashion MNIST Image Classifier ‚Äì Desktop Application using CNN and Tkinter : 
This project is a desktop application built using Python, TensorFlow, and Tkinter. It enables users to classify images of fashion items (such as shirts, dresses, and sneakers) by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The app offers a simple and intuitive GUI for uploading images and viewing classification results.

Purpose of the Project
The application demonstrates how deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, can be applied to image classification tasks. It is designed for educational purposes, early-stage machine learning learners, and anyone interested in exploring computer vision through hands-on interaction.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python ‚Äì Programming language used for backend logic and interface.

TensorFlow & Keras ‚Äì For building, training, and loading the deep learning model.

NumPy ‚Äì For numerical data manipulation.

Pillow (PIL) ‚Äì For image processing.

Tkinter ‚Äì For building the GUI.

Features of the Application
üß† CNN Model for Fashion Classification
The application uses a custom-built CNN model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset ‚Äî a widely used dataset for clothing image classification with 10 different fashion categories:

T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

üèóÔ∏è Model Training and Persistence
If a saved model file (fashion_model.h5) is not found, the application automatically trains a CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset and saves the model for future use.

üìÇ Upload and Classify Images
Users can upload .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images of fashion items using a Select Image button. The image is displayed in the GUI, and the model predicts the closest matching fashion category.

üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing
Uploaded images are:

Converted to grayscale

Resized to 28x28 pixels

Normalized to match the model's input format

üìä Real-Time Prediction
Once the image is processed, the model returns a prediction label which is immediately displayed below the image.

Advantages and Use Cases
Helps users understand CNN-based image classification.

No coding required ‚Äî accessible via a clean and intuitive interface.

Ideal for education, demonstrations, or quick experiments.

Can be adapted to classify other image datasets by changing the training data and model structure.

Conclusion : 
The Fashion MNIST Image Classifier is a powerful yet beginner-friendly desktop application that combines deep learning and graphical interfaces. With automatic model training, real-time image predictions, and a simple GUI, it offers a complete experience for exploring the potential of computer vision using neural networks.
